# Wildfire-detection-based-on-MCD64A1
The MCD64A1 data was used to locate the fire point and non-fire point position, and the fuel moisture content(FMC) and foliage fuel load(FFL) before the fire occurred were collected, and the logistic regression model was established to estimate the probability of fire occurrence. This project is implemented based on MATLAB.
